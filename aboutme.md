### Background
I was born in France where I grew up untill the age of 5. We then moved to Copenhagen, Denmark for three year then to Toronto, Canada for five years before returning to France. After graduating from high-school in 2011, I enrolled at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne in France, an institution mixing France Engineering Schools and University models. In 2016, I obtained a degree in biological engineering (Design and Innovation of Bioproducts). Having done two 6-months intership's at two different labs, I wanted to continue working in research. In September 2017, I started a research project at the University of Montreal.
The goal of my Ph.D., co-supervised by Mohamed Hijri and Maxime Paré, is to study the bacterial and fungal communities of the wild blueberry root environment.

My professional goal is to contribute to the development of innovative and sustainable methods in the fields of agricultural biotechnology and biocontrols.
